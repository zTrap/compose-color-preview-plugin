/**
 * Defines the parameters for the ICC parametric curve type 4, as
 * defined in ICC.1:2004-10, section 10.15.
 *
 * [The EOTF is of the form linked here](https://d.android.com/reference/android/graphics/ColorSpace.Rgb.TransferParameters)
 *
 * The corresponding OETF is simply the inverse function.
 *
 * The parameters defined by this class form a valid transfer
 * function only if all the following conditions are met:
 *
 *  * No parameter is a [Not-a-Number][Double.isNaN]
 *  * `d` is in the range `[0..1]`
 *  * The function is not constant
 *  * The function is positive and increasing
