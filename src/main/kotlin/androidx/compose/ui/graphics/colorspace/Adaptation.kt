/**
 * List of adaptation matrices that can be used for chromatic adaptation
 * using the von Kries transform. These matrices are used to convert values
 * in the CIE XYZ space to values in the LMS space (Long Medium Short).
 *
 * Given an adaptation matrix `A`, the conversion from XYZ to
 * LMS is straightforward:
 *
 * [See equation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/ColorSpace.Adaptation.html)
 *
 * The complete von Kries transform `T` uses a diagonal matrix
 * noted `D` to perform the adaptation in LMS space. In addition
 * to `A` and `D`, the source white point `W1` and the destination
 * white point `W2` must be specified:
 *
 * [See equation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/ColorSpace.Adaptation.html)
 *
 * As an example, the resulting matrix `T` can then be used to
 * perform the chromatic adaptation of sRGB XYZ transform from D65
 * to D50:
